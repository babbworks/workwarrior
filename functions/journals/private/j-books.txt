[2025-07-02 12:36:23 AM] @neareastacc Two parallel developments evolved hand in hand for about half a millennium.
First, numeracy and quantitative measurement were need­ ed to extend the control over nature to include the rhythms o f the large institutions—their seasonal schedule of planting and harvesting, and the monthly rhythm of provisioning their workshops and dependent labor so as to coordinate the large flows involved. Second, written nota­ tion was needed to track and quantify these resource flows, and to clas­ sify the disbursements and receipts for a myriad of activities.

[2025-07-02 01:05:36 AM] @neareastacc To coordinate these activities the Sumerians created a cluster of interlocking innovations in a “big bang” as a unified-field approach. An administrative calendar based on uniform 30-day months led to the
sexagesimal system of counting and dividing into 60ths, and a match­ ing sexagesimal set of weights and measures to allocate rations to the work force for monthly and daily use. Mutual price equivalencies were assigned for key commodities and the rental rate for land (see Renger 1995). These prices served as coefficients to form a grid of equivalen­ cies in which barley and silver emerged as the basic reference prices or “money-of-account.” Setting these two commodities as a joint standard of value enabled disparate transactions to be organized into an inte­ grated system in which an overall balance could be struck to measure the net gain or loss.

The State, then the Palaces Regime and its scribes et al, had origins for accounting in resource allocation for ensuring sufficient supplies for the maintenance of the Palace the the carrying out of public works and projects ie enough food and materials and labor. They created a stable environment for life and with some time the notion of the Palace and its stabilized territory were synonymous, a contrast to the unsecured wild world beyond its borders.

[2025-07-02 02:51:21 AM] Writing emerges from numeric account keeping as an extension possibly from symbols, flags or indicators for things that were commonly tracked.
Tokens were the first economic representation, small clay things in symbolic shapes often with markings and maybe holes to represent traded goods. Emerging rep. 7500-3500bc. Cones, spheres, disks, cylinders. Tetrahedrons for labor units.

[2025-07-02 02:56:49 AM] #neareastacc @tokens Use of disc tokens of slightly varying sizes appears to be the earliest mode of abstracted exchange or record keeping with the connotations for debt or gift recognition?

[2025-07-02 03:03:03 AM] @neareastacc Earliest forms of quantity, when viewed from the Palace origination perspective, would have more often referred to a speculative capacity marker or needs statementt IE early goal setting.
We can draw from this that quantity difference from requested to gathered shows a plus or minus against the goal.

[2025-07-02 03:35:30 AM] @time @labor Pre-literate records show notation for number of individuals, gender and age.
This holds as a system for evaluating or, prior to work, estimation of potential productivity for the group, and therefore a yardstick by which to advance resources to the laborers. Work capacity as a form of risk rating.
