Topic: Command line logging of insights
Importance: Speed of work
Discoveries: JRNL tool can be harnessed to create numerous journals. When paired with a bash script, a set of questions can be activated to guide the recording of insights and observations.
Connections: Has application with use of other command line tools including Inference Models.
Technical: Bash Script is made into an executable. Alternative journal is created, given an alias, then identified in the script. Alt approach is to create a command to set environment variable for default journal to specialty journal, then adjust script to reflect this sequence.
