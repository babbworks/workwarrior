## WORKWARRIOR

Productivity is personal. In the pursuit of team and remote collaboration, the 
legibility of graphical interfaces was traded for the speed of the terminal. 
Workwarrior ties together the functionality of existing CLIs (Command Line Interfaces) 
using scripts of all kinds to support daily discipline. The productive developer, 
researcher, scientist or artist needs, at minimum, to continually perform 4 types of 
logging and tracking: tasks, actions (i.e. logging time), notes, and exchanges. For 
devout practicioners, local engagement with Large Language Models and Inference Agents 
via the command line is emerging as an absolute must. The high volume of daily prompts 
and responses is creating novel pressures on the need to save, prioritize, summarize, 
collate and export information at novel volumes. With tools like Ollama as well in-tool 
AI chat with attached context, the need to support Text Input Management (TIM) is 
pressing. As other primary and secondary needs are discovered, github archaeology will 
be undertaken to locate and include tools that address those issues.

### Version 1
The 4 Daily Disciplines of creating and managing Tasks, Actions, Notes and Exchanges 
will be brought into harmony through the use of Taskwarrior, Timewarrior, JRNL, and 
Hledger. The Arts of Inference will also be supported using an early TIM model named 
"Lee". Known extensions to these tools are being documented on an on-going basis.
